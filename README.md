# Ad-hoc-SQL-Analysis-Media-Business-Insights-2019-2024-
An ad-hoc SQL analysis project addressing stakeholder business requests using media datasets (2019â€“2024). Queries explored circulation drops, revenue concentration, print efficiency, city readiness, and digital adoption to uncover actionable business insights


This project involves ad-hoc analysis on a media dataset to extract actionable insights across six key business areas. Using SQL, we identify months with the sharpest drop in net circulation, detect ad categories contributing over 50% of yearly revenue, and rank cities by print efficiency in 2024. Additionally, we track internet readiness growth during 2021, identify cities with consistent multi-year declines in both circulation and ad revenue, and flag outliers where digital readiness is high but engagement is low. The analysis leverages fact and dimension tables covering sales, advertising, city readiness, and digital pilot data to support data-driven decision-making.
